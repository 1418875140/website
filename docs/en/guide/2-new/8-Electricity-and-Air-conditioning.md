# Ways to pay for electricity and air conditioning

- Electricity and air conditioning are required to **pay to use**, and are **paid separately**.

- It is recommended to **check** the balance of electricity from time to time, or **pay a little more** (not too much), so as not to " hate less when the electricity is used ".

- After all, you don't want to see a sudden power outage on Friday or Saturday night, and then the phone can't charge, WiFi is down, game is down (don't ask me how I know > _ <).

- Ah, by the way, the new students will not have such a doubt: obviously I did not pay, but also can turn on the light, can charge something. The answer is because the previous seniors charged a little more (do not rule out that the school does not require payment for a period of time when the new students have just started).

The following is the payment operation ~

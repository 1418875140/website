## Use text
Dear students,
Use Alipay to recharge the campus card, Please remember to **swipe your card in the canteen** . Not all credit card machines on campus are connected to the Internet. Only the first to the **canteen received money and then consumption** is correct!


### # For example:

> Xiao Ming: Teacher, why can't I transfer my campus card
>
> Xiaoming: Is it because Alipay delays to the account?

> Teacher: After the transfer, go to the canteen to take the card to get the money! After the transfer, the children went directly to the supermarket or the high street to consume, and they could not see the money of this transfer! Alipay transfer is real-time to the account, there is no delay to the account problem oh!

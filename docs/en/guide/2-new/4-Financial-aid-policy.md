The average subsidy standard for full-time undergraduate and vocational students from economically disadvantaged families (including preparatory, vocational, and second bachelor's degree students, excluding retired soldier students) included in the national enrollment plan is 3300 yuan per student per year. The specific standard is determined by universities within the range of 2000-4500 yuan per student per year and can be divided into 2-3 levels. Full time retired soldier students on campus are entitled to the national scholarship for undergraduate and junior college students, with a subsidy standard of 3300 yuan per student per year.

### 4. National student loans
National student loans are credit loans provided by the government and financial institutions to economically disadvantaged students in universities. They are prioritized for paying tuition and accommodation fees during their school years, and any excess can be used to cover daily living expenses. The maximum amount per person per year is 16000 yuan, and the interest during their school years is borne by the state. The term of the student loan is 15 years after the school system, with a maximum of 22 years. The interest rate for student loans shall be calculated by subtracting 60 basis points from the market quoted interest rate (LPR) for loans of the same period and grade. The national student loan is divided into the student origin credit loan and the campus national student loan. Students with loan needs can consult with the student aid management department of the county (city, district, flag) where their registered residence is located to apply for the student origin credit loan, or consult with the student aid management department of the university to apply for the campus national student loan. Borrowed students cannot apply for both local credit student loans and campus national student loans simultaneously within the same academic year.

The amount of tuition compensation or national student loan compensation shall be based on the higher of the actual tuition paid by the student or the national student loan used for tuition (including the principal and interest generated before full repayment); The amount of tuition fee reduction after resuming or enrolling new students shall be based on the actual tuition fee charged by the higher education institution. The standards for tuition compensation, national student loan compensation, and tuition fee reduction shall not exceed 16000 yuan per student per year. Any amount exceeding the standard shall not be compensated, compensated, or reduced.

## Kind Reminder
To apply for recognition as a financially disadvantaged student, you need to fill out an application form. This form can be downloaded from the "Policy Documents - Comprehensive Policies" section of the National Student Financial Assistance Management Center website. It does not require a seal, but requires a personal commitment and signature. We hope you will be honest, trustworthy, and truthfully fill out the form.

## Security Warning
Before and after the start of school, there is often a high incidence of telecommunications and Internet fraud. Some fraudsters will impersonate university teachers, staff of funding institutions, etc., send text messages, call new students, add WeChat or QQ friends, use various means to defraud money, or issue Internet consumer loans, and induce students to participate in various skills training through non-performing loans such as "learning before paying" and "interest free installment", so that students fall into the trap of high-value loans. Please keep your eyes open, be vigilant, resist temptation, and avoid being deceived.

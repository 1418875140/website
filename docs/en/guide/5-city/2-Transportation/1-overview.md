# Overview of Tianjin Transportation

Tianjin's public transportation consists of subways and buses

- Subway ticket purchasing is divided into two types: physical tickets and electronic tickets. Physical tickets need to be purchased at self-service ticket machines or service counters, while electronic tickets require downloading the Tianjin Metro APP for QR code access (also supports NFC or face scanning), making it more convenient.

- The main way of bus ticket purchase is changed to Tianjin in Alipay's `travel` applet, and you can apply for a traffic card.

There is a saying about the dual city model in Tianjin, which refers to the development of Tianjin and Binhai New Area in two cities. Therefore, the public transportation card in Binhai New Area needs to be applied for separately and is not compatible with the Tianjin transportation card.

The main mode of transportation in Binhai New Area is public transportation, with only Line 9 subway. However, as long as it connects the city and Binhai, it is not considered the main mode of transportation within Binhai New Area.
